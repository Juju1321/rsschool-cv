## Information about me
Last year I graduated from the university with a degree in economics. Found a job at a bank. I'm planning to develop in programming, because I like it at the moment. It’s not boring .. My strengths: I always try to complete the job to the end, I try to complete all tasks, responsible, persistent. My weaknesses: I am often afraid of something, modest and sometimes I do not believe in myself. I have no work experience yet, but I can’t wait to get it.
